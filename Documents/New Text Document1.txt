VIX-Based Market Range Projection Model

Base Inputs Symbol Meaning 
C Previous day’s close 
V Current VIX (volatility index) 
D Number of trading days in the target period 
Y Number of trading days in a year (≈ 365)

1 Convert Volatility to Decimal v = V / 100

2 Adjust for Time Period t = √(D / Y)

3 Compute Expected Range R = C × v × t This gives the expected movement (± R) from the previous close.

4 Define Range Levels Upper Range = C + R Lower Range = C − R


5 Define Breakout Targets Let G = 2R

Upside Target = C + 3R Downside Target = C − 3R

Optional intermediate targets: Type Formula First Target C ± R Second Target C ± 2R Third Target C ± 3R

Practical Values for D Period D √(D/365) Daily 1 0.0523 Weekly 5 0.1171 Monthly 30 0.2867


Example (Using NIFTY-style values) Given: C = 24426.85, V = 17.86 Range formula: R = C × (V / 100) × √(D / 365)

Period Range (R) Upper Range Lower Range Daily 228 24 655 24 199 Weekly 510 24 937 23 917 Monthly 1 250 25 676 23 177

Final Compact Formula Set Output Formula Range (R) = C × (V / 100) × √(D / 365) Upper Range = C + R Lower Range = C − R Upside Target = C + 3R Downside Target = C − 3R


Delta (Δ) Measures how much the option price changes when the underlying asset price changes. Δ_call = N(d1) Δ_put = N(d1) − 1 Interpretation: • Call Δ ≈ 1 — behaves like the stock. • Put Δ ≈ −1 — behaves opposite to the stock.

Gamma (Γ) Measures how much Delta changes as the stock price moves — the curvature of the option’s value. Γ = N′(d1) / (S0 σ √T) where N′(d1) = (1 / √(2π)) e^(−d1² / 2) Interpretation: High Gamma = Delta moves fast (near the money, close to expiry).

Theta (Θ) Measures how much the option’s price decays as time passes (time decay). Θ_call = − (S0 N′(d1) σ) / (2√T) − r K e^(−r T) N(d2) Θ_put = − (S0 N′(d1) σ) / (2√T) + r K e^(−r T) N(−d2) Interpretation: Theta is almost always negative for long options — value melts with time.

Vega (ν) Measures how much the option price changes when volatility (σ) changes. ν = S0 N′(d1) √T Interpretation: High Vega = highly sensitive to implied volatility — typical for ATM options.

Rho (ρ) Measures how much the option price changes when the interest rate (r) changes. ρ_call = K T e^(−r T) N(d2) ρ_put = − K T e^(−r T) N(−d2)

Alpha (α) and Beta (β) in Trading Context They’re not Greeks in the Black-Scholes sense — but traders use them differently:

Symbol | Formula | Meaning α (Alpha) | α = Ri − [ rf + β (Rm − rf) ] | Excess return (performance vs. risk-adjusted benchmark) β (Beta) | β = Cov(Ri, Rm) / Var(Rm) | Market sensitivity or hedge ratio

Deep In-the-Money (ITM) Call Option: C = S0 N(d1) − K e^(−r T) N(d2) When S0 ≫ K: • ln(S0 / K) is large — d1, d2 both large and positive. • N(d1) ≈ 1 and N(d2) ≈ 1. So the formula simplifies to: C ≈ S0 − K e^(−r T) This means: The option is almost equivalent to owning the stock minus the present value of the strike.

Deep In-the-Money (ITM) Put Option: P = K e^(−r T) N(−d2) − S0 N(−d1) When S0 ≪ K: • d1, d2 both large and negative. • N(−d1) ≈ 1 and N(−d2) ≈ 1. So it simplifies to: P ≈ K e^(−r T) − S0 Which means: The option is nearly equivalent to receiving the strike’s present value minus the current stock price.

In short: Type | Deep ITM Simplification | Intuition Call | C ≈ S0 − K e^(−r T) | Like owning the stock minus PV of strike Put | P ≈ K e^(−r T) − S0 | Like shorting the stock plus PV of strike
